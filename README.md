# DataScienceProject

## Description 
Data Science project, hands on TF(with Keras), Pandas (DataFrames) &amp; others (Numpy, Matplotlib, etc...)

## Data
The data is fetched from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Those are room occupency data: Temperature, Humidity ratio, CO2 level, etc... with human presence in room.

## Project
The project idea was to come up with a data analysis method. In the end, the goal was to infer about wether or not the room was occupied. The steps were the following
- Data visualisation
- Logistic regression 
- SVM
- Neuronal Network

### Used Libraries
For this project, the following libraries have been used:
- Scikit-learn (logisitc regression, SVM)
- Panda (Dataframe)
- Tensorflow
